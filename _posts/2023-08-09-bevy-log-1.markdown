# Bevy 0.11: A Closer Look

A few weeks back, Bevy 0.11 was unveiled, marking a notable step forward in improving system scheduling ergonomics. Since then, most of the crates I regularly use have transitioned to this new version. With this shift, I'm considering revisiting a game I crafted that spans roughly 2,000 lines of code. But as I set out on this journey, there are a handful of initial decisions I'm thinking about revising.

For instance, this segment concerning input could use some tidying up:

{% highlight rust %}
match left_click {
LeftClick::Pickup(Some(e)) => {
if let Some(server_entity) = network_mapping.client.remove(e) {
player_commands.send(PlayerCommand::LeftClick(
LeftClick::Pickup(Some(server_entity)),
*tile,
));
}
//delete_writer.send(DeleteMe(*e));
commands.entity(*e).despawn_recursive();
}
LeftClick::Attack(e) => {
if let Some(server_entity) = network_mapping.client.get(e) {
println!("attack");
player_commands.send(PlayerCommand::LeftClick(LeftClick::Attack(*server_entity), *tile));
}
}
...
{% endhighlight %}

It's pretty clear that juggling three levels of enums for a basic input event is less than ideal. Besides this, I'm excited to test out some crates, like bevy_proto, which promises to make adding content to the game smoother. I'm also toying with the idea of crafting a basic editor, though I'm weighing the effort that might involve.
